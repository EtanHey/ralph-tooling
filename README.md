**Claude Golem** (codenamed `ralph`) is an autonomous wrapper and context-engineering framework for [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code). It transforms Claude from a chat-based assistant into a persistent, self-correcting agent capable of executing complex PRDs through iterative development loops.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Autonomous Iteration:** Runs Claude in a continuous loop with self-correction and state persistence.
- **📊 Real-time Dashboard:** A React-based TUI (built with Bun/Ink) to monitor progress, costs, and model performance.
- **🛡️ Process Management:** Built-in tools to manage worktrees, clean up orphaned processes, and handle "context rot."
- **🔀 Smart Model Routing:** Automatically switch between Opus (planning), Sonnet (implementation), and Haiku (validation) to optimize cost and speed.
- **🔐 1Password Integration:** Securely injects environment variables and API keys directly from your vaults.
- **📋 Spec-Driven Workflow:** Native support for User Stories (US), Bugs, and PRDs with automated context loading.
- **⚡ Live Criteria Sync:** `fswatch` file watching with ANSI cursor updates for a seamless dev experience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and run setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EtanHey/claude-golem.git ~/Gits/claude-golem
cd ~/Gits/claude-golem

# Run the interactive setup wizard (creates ~/.config/ralphtools/)
source ralph.zsh && ralph-setup

```

### 2. Configuration

Ralph stores its configuration in `~/.config/ralphtools/config.json`.
The setup wizard will help you configure:

* Your default model (Sonnet, Opus, etc.)
* Notification settings (via `ntfy.sh`)
* 1Password vault references

### 3. First Run

Start an autonomous loop for 50 iterations using Sonnet:

```bash
ralph 50 --sonnet

```

## 📂 Project Structure & Workflow

### The "Story" Workflow

Ralph is optimized for a **Spec-Driven** approach. Before running the agent:

1. **Define:** Create a markdown file in `prompts/` (e.g., `prompts/US-123.md`).
2. **Initialize:** Run `ralph-init` to generate the PRD and project context.
3. **Execute:** Run `ralph` to begin the implementation loop.

### Directory Layout

* `lib/`: Core Zsh modules and command logic.
* `ralph-ui/`: TypeScript/Ink dashboard source code.
* `skills/`: Custom "Golem Powers" (MCP-like skills) injected into Claude.
* `contexts/`: Shared rules (like `CLAUDE.md`) for different project types.

---

## 🧩 Advanced Features

### 🔀 Smart Model Routing

Override the default model for specific tasks using flags:

* `-O, --opus`: Best for high-level architecture and complex debugging.
* `-S, --sonnet`: The gold standard for implementation.
* `-H, --haiku`: Fastest for unit tests and documentation.
* `-K, --kiro-cli`: Amazons cli, wrapping Claude.
* `-G, --gemini`: Google's models via Gemini CLI.
* `-L, --local`: Use local LLMs via Ollama/Aider.

### 🛠️ Custom Golem Powers (Extensibility)

Ralph is a platform for agentic workflows. You can inject custom behaviors into Claude:

* **Custom Skills:** Drop any script into `skills/golem-powers/` and Ralph will automatically register it as a tool for Claude.
* **Context Rules:** Use `contexts/` to define per-project rules Claude must follow (e.g., "Always use Tailwind for styling").

### 🔐 1Password Secrets

Ralph can fetch your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` securely. In your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "secrets": {
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "op://Private/Anthropic/credential"
  }
}

```

## ⚙️ Internal Architecture (For Contributors)

For developers looking to extend the core loop or modify shell integration:

### Core Functions

* **`repoGolem()`**: The "Master Hook." Scans the environment, loads `config.json`, and prepares session state.
* **`ralph-loop`**: Manages the iterative logic and handles Claude's exit codes to decide on restarts.
* **`ralph-check-health`**: Internal diagnostic tool ensuring `fswatch` and `bun` are communicating.

### Process Monitoring

If a session hangs, use `ralph-watch` to see raw sub-agent output, or `ralph-kill-orphans --all` to reset the environment by clearing untracked `fswatch` and `bun` processes.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Check `ralph-logs` for any current system bugs.
2. Follow the [Spec-Driven Development Methodology](https://www.google.com/search?q=docs/methodology.md) guide.
3. Run `ralph-terminal-check` to verify your environment before submitting PRs.

## 🔄 Changelog

### v2.0.0
