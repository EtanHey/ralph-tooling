## Iteration 1 - BUG-025: Context content leaks to stdout during iteration
- Model: opus
- Root cause: When the CLI command is executed (line 5222), `${cli_cmd_arr[@]}` expansion includes the context_content. If the user's shell has xtrace enabled globally, this would print the entire context.
- Fix: Added `setopt localoptions noxtrace` at line 5223 to suppress debug output during CLI execution. This complements existing noxtrace blocks at context building (line 3614) and array assignment (line 5115).
- All 205 tests pass
