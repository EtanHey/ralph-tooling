# Ralph Progress - Fresh Start
Started: Sun Jan 25 05:24:03 IST 2026

(Previous progress archived to docs.local/prd-archive/)

## Iteration 1 - BUG-025: Context content leaks to stdout during iteration
- Model: opus
- Root cause: When the CLI command is executed (line 5222), `${cli_cmd_arr[@]}` expansion includes the context_content. If the user's shell has xtrace enabled globally, this would print the entire context.
- Fix: Added `setopt localoptions noxtrace` at line 5223 to suppress debug output during CLI execution. This complements existing noxtrace blocks at context building (line 3614) and array assignment (line 5115).
- All 205 tests pass


## Iteration 2 - V-012: Verify Full System Audit Post-Rename
- Model: haiku
- Comprehensive verification of ralph migration and rename:
  - Criterion 1 PASS: ralphtools references minimal/acceptable (system config paths, git history)
  - Criterion 2 PASS: /github skill invocation works
  - Criterion 3 PASS: /linear skill invocation works
  - Criterion 4 PASS: /convex skill invocation works
  - Criterion 5 PASS: prd-json stories accessible from new location (19 files verified)
  - Criterion 6 PASS: ralph full loop confirmed working (7 commits from completed stories)
  - Criterion 7 PASS: Documented acceptable 'ralphtools' references
  - Criterion 8 PASS: Created docs.local/rename-complete.md confirming migration success
  - Criterion 9 PASS: CodeRabbit review (no uncommitted code changes to review)
- CodeRabbit: Passed (no code changes - verification only)
- All 205 tests pass
- V-012 COMPLETE - Ralph system fully operational post-rename
