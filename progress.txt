# Ralph Progress - v2 Skills + Bug Fixes

Started: Fri Jan 23 14:56:32 IST 2026

## Iteration 1 - US-032: Skills Discovery command (/skills)
**Status**: COMPLETED

Created `/skills` command that:
- Scans ~/.claude/commands/ for all installed skills
- Detects both single-file (.md) and multi-file (SKILL.md) formats
- Extracts descriptions from YAML frontmatter or first blockquote
- Groups skills by category (Infrastructure, Domain, Custom)
- Shows skill source (ralphtools, superpowers, ralph-config, custom)
- Counts workflows for progressive disclosure skills
- Supports --search keyword filtering

Files created:
- /Users/etanheyman/Desktop/Gits/ralphtools/skills/skills.md
- Symlinked to ~/.claude/commands/skills.md

### Learnings
- Skills use YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Multi-file skills have SKILL.md at root with workflows/ subdirectory
- Source detection via symlink resolution (readlink -f)
